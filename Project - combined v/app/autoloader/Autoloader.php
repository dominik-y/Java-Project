/**
 * Note: Class names in PHP are case insensitive. The following two are equivalent:
 *     class Something extends BaseClass {}
 * and
 *     class someThing extends baseclass {}
 * 
 * If you are using an autoloader that searches for a class file when the class 
 * is required, the autoloader will match the file based on the filesystem’s 
 * case-sensitivity. 
 *      - Windows is case insensitive
 *      - Mac  is case-aware but not case sensitive. 
 *      - Linux is case sensitive, and Solace is Linux
 * 
 * Hence, FOR SOLACE, we will need to 
 *      - rename all php files to lowercase OR
 *      - use the ucfirst() in the autoloader on class names as below (make sure the class name consists of one word only)
